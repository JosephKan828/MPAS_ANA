# EAPE Budget Equation
According to Nakamura and Takayabu (2023), the EAPE budget equation is written as:
$$
    \frac{1}{2\sigma}\alpha^{\prime 2} = \alpha^\prime\omega^\prime + \frac{R}{p C_p \sigma} \alpha^\prime Q_1^\prime
$$

where $\sigma$ is static stability defined as 
$-\frac{1}{[\rho][\theta]}\frac{\partial [\theta]}{\partial p}$, where the square bracket means the average taken in time and longitude. The prime denotes the deviation from such average value. All the other symbols follow convention in meteorology.
